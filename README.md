# Amazon DeepRacer with LiDAR - ASU Capstone Project

The project was completed as the team's undergraduate electrical engineering capstone during the 2024-2025 school year. This repository contains the files used during the project.

## Project Description

A SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) using LiDAR. Using Amazon Deep Racer, train the system to navigate a path using camera and LiDAR. While navigating the area, collect LiDAR data to be used for SLAM. A LiDAR-based SLAM system uses a laser sensor to generate a 3D map of its environment. Using the collected data, create a 3D rendering of the path that was taken during the navigation. Using MATLAB or python can be used to generate the 3D map.
